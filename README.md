# Matlab-Ardunio
 Distance meter and graph using echo sensor

PROJECT OBJECTIVE

1. To make meaningful data from the data obtained by the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor via Arduino.
2. To integrate Arduino data into computer environment and access this data via MATLAB.
3. To create a functional interface with MATLAB GUI, print the instantaneous distance information received from Arduino to the interface, and draw a real-time distance-time graph.
